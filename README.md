## Usage:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements
3. Run benchmark/evaluate.py to evaluate final model and see example of recommendation in comparison to ideal recommendation*

*However, if you do not want to go through all these steps, you can go to notebooks/2.0_final_solution_evaluation_and_recommendation.ipynb 
to see the cells with the outputs mentioned above.

Also, there is no benchmark/data, intermediate and external data, as all preprocessing takes low time.
